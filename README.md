# TestForRubyGarage
Hello, this is my test-work for Ruby Garage. I used PHP language. Application 'Im PLAN' is very comfortable program, which helps to compose personal task lists. It works as with JS sqripts in user`s browser as without it. Also my programm uses RedBean, because it helps to avoid SQL-injections. The plugin "Drag and Drop",ajax technology and jquery library were used. 
This application can change task and sequence of their recording ("Drag and Drop" or special arrow-button in row of table).Thank you for watching!
